        <h1> Grilled Octopus</h1>
        <img src="../images/octopus.jpg">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Grilled octopus consists of either whole octopus or octopus tentacles cooked over the direct heat of an outdoor charcoal or gas grill. Grilling fresh octopus is a simple way to make this ingredient shine. A braise in boiling water beforehand will tenderize the meat and make it ready to absorb any marinade. The char of the grill amps up its taste and its tender-yet-chewy texture, making octopus a versatile appetizer, side dish, or main.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>3 rosemary sprigs</li>
            <li>10 whole black peppercorns</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons salt, divided</li>
            <li>5 garlic cloves, smashed</li>
            <li>3 lemons, divided </li>
            <li>1 3-pound octopus, cleaned, beak and eyes removed </li>
            <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil </li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped parsley, tarragon, and dill, to garnish  </li>
            <li>Flaky salt, to garnish </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
           <li>Fill a large pot with water and add the bay leaves, rosemary, peppercorns, 1 teaspoon of the salt, the garlic cloves, and 1 lemon, halved.</li>
           
           <li>Bring the braising liquid to a boil.</li>
           
           <li>Add the octopus to the boiling water and lower the heat to a simmer, cooking until the octopus is tender, approximately 45 minutes. (Test the meat’s tenderness by piercing it with a sharp knife.)</li>
           
           <li>Using tongs, remove the octopus from the braising liquid and cut it into large pieces. Set the octopus aside to cool.</li>
           
           <li>In a medium bowl, combine the olive oil, black pepper, and the juice of 1 lemon.</li>
           
           <li>Add the cooled octopus to the marinade, cover, and refrigerate it for at least 2 hours or up to overnight.</li>
           
           <li>Start a charcoal or wood fire, or preheat your gas grill to high heat.</li>
           
           <li>Grill the octopus pieces until their exterior browns, but they’re still juicy inside, approximately 3–4 minutes per side.</li>
           
           <li>Remove the octopus pieces from the grill quickly, so they don’t overcook.</li>
           
           <li>Slice the remaining lemon into wedges and serve alongside the octopus.</li>
           
           <li>Garnish the grilled octopus with fresh herbs and flaky salt.</li>

        </ol>
